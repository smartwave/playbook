title: Know your opportunity in and out

Entrepreneurship is largely about managing your relationship to risk. Every step an entrepreneur takes in growing their business is a risk, and the only way you can reduce some of that risk is by having a solid understanding of your market and your customers. Outside of personal development, market knowledge and validation is probably the single greatest factor for a new business to succeed.
