title: Stay aware of our personal strengths & weaknesses
---

One of the most common things to happen with entrepreneurs at any stage is to get so focused on the work that we forget to check in with ourselves. After all, the entrepreneur leadership team is the one driving the strategic direction, and if we are unaware of the things affecting us we may make a disastrous decision.

### Checklist
1. Take time once every week to reflect on your state of mind
2. Identify a trusted person that can give you objective feedback
3. Share your personal findings with your leadership team, or staff if you like
4. For each weakness, identify one thing you could do every day or week to immediately improve it
5. Never take any idea off the table, unless it conflicts with our ethics, morals or core values


### Key Questions
- How large could we be in 10 years in terms of geogrpahic coverage, team size and revenue?
- What kind of company do we want to be, how will we conduct ourselves?
- What kind of business model would we need for our vision to happen?
- How could we evaluate our success along the way?
