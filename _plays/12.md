title: Keep metrics simple, effective and manageable
---

Data helps entrepreneurs make thoughtful decisions. However, many entrepreneurs are holding multiple responsibilities, and the thought of tracking yet another piece of data can be daunting. To counteract that, it is important that we  choose to track the information we need to be able to make decisions over the next 12 months, and only track more than that if we have extra time/capacity.

### Checklist
1. Measure basic financials - Gross Revenue, Net Profit, Cash on Hand
2. Measure one basic culture metric, something that tells us if we are doing the right kind of work
3. Measure one metric of your impact outside of your organization and not directly related to generating revenue, based on one of your core values
4. Track as much of your time as you can
5. Track enough information to get a 'good enough' sense of your performance
6. Identify which metrics are Leading (indicating performance in the future)
7. Identify which metrics are Trailing (they verify if performance has occurred, usually financials)

### Key Questions
- Do we have more than 6 metrics?
- Does tracking information feel like a full time job? 
- Do all team members understand why we are tracking this information?
- Are we putting this information into a place that others can view it?
- Can we combine data from multiple sources to do some light analysis over time?
