title: Manage your relationships as if they were the most important thing to your business
---

Because they are! Every person you meet that hears of you and your business is a potential relationship. Over time, relationships equate to money in the form of customers, partners, advisors or investors. Relationships can be built slowly or quickly. Building them always requires building and maintaining trust, and the level of trust depends on your business model, value proposition and  customer relationship. 

Whiel this holds true for customers and investors, it also holds true for trust internally with staff, advisors and partners. Using your core values and value proposition to shape how you build and establish trust with each internal and external stakeholder is a helpful exercise that can take a lot of guesswork out of how to get things done.

### Checklist
1. Use personas to outline what relationship expectations each stakeholder might have
2. Embrace trust and openness as a communication policy

### Key Questions
- Are we building meaningful relationships with external & internal stakeholders?
- Do we constantly have to "finesse" the truth?
- Are we connected to the people we work for?
- Are we connected to the other people on our team?
