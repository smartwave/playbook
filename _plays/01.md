title: Understand what drives us
---

When we are starting a business, we are potentially building something bigger than ourselves. We are also taking a bunch of risks, some that are big and many, many others that are small. Before we start planning our business and all of the money we are going to potentially make, we should know where we are and what is driving us and the business idea. Whether our goal is a solo/project business, a small business with a local focus or a high-growth service that will attract big venture capital dollars, we want to know the strengths and weaknesses of our team before getting into marketplace. This is the first step in reducing risk, and is a really good practice to get into to "check ourselves" along the way.

### Checklist
1. Perform an evaluation with yourself or your peers of your strengths and weaknesses
2. Identify your "exit point"
3. Make sure all of your leadership team is involved

### Key Questions
- What do you value most?
- What drives your decisions?
- If your business became successful, what would someone have to offer you to buy your business in, say 10 years?
- What do you want your personal ecosystem to look like?
- How large could we be in 10 years in terms of geographic coverage, team size and revenue?
- What kind of company do we want to be, how will we conduct ourselves?
- What kind of business model would we need for our vision to happen?
- How could we evaluate our success along the way?
