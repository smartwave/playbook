title: Stay aware of our strenghts, weaknesses
---

A business can be more than the sum of it's parts, but of the people running the business (leaders & staff) are not maintaining a healthy lifestyle and self awareness, the business can suffer. It isn't easy being self aware, and it's less easy learning how to share and communicate effectively. Learning how to do that with yourself and your team is one of the defining traits of longevity for a business. If you know where you are weak, you know where you need to focus yourself, your team and your business.
