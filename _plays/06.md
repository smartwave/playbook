title: Before starting, changing or pivoting, make the numbers work first
---

While being an entrepreneur is mostly about taking risks and growing a business is about understanding, _running a business_ is far more about numbers. If the numbers don't work out, the best idea in the world isn't likely to succeed. Knowing the numbers can _significantly_ increase the likelihood that your business will move past the three year mark (a defining point in a small business) and continue to grow.

### Checklist
1. Review your Business Model Canvas
2. Conduct simplified market research to identify opportunity sizes and quantities
3. Identify the _real_ price for your products/services
4. Identify the _total_ cost for your products/services (hours by person, administration, materials, permits, etc.)
5. Plot out a 12 month Projected Sales Forecast
6. Project growth over three years
7. Always be realistic, _then make the numbers a little more conservative_

### Key Questions
- Do we have an accurate budget for the work we currently are doing?
- If we make this change, do we know with a high degree of probability that it will help us?
- Have we validated our new pricing with actual customers?
